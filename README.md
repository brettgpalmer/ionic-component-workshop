Examples of Ionic V4 Components for meetup workshop
This repo contains small individual workshops demonstrating many Ionic components.
Each workshop should have a "start" branch and a "final" branch.  

**For example:**
* card-example-start branch: contains the code to start working on Ionic Card Components
* cord-example-final branch: contains the complete solution for Ionic Card Component example.

Each Component example starts be using the following Ionic CLI command:

*ionic start <ComponentExampleApp> sidemenu --type=angular* this generates a new Ionic application with a simple sidemenu. Then we add an example page to demo the specific component.

**For example:**
* CD into the new sample project
* ionic g page <component-example>
* ionic g page card-example
